Yes, I know it’s not the best way to start a blog, but I thought it’d be good starting being honest with all of you. This brings my first topic</p>\n<h2>Who are you?</h2>\n<p>What’s your profession? what are your interests? what do you do for fun? it’s important for me to know this information to tell you if this blog is suited for you. Well, I guess you can’t answer me, so I’ll tell you what I’d expect from you. I’ll expect two kind of readers on this blog: people who will want to improve their development skills and people who want to know my personal experiences from a more human point of view</p>\n<h2>Who am I?</h2>\n<p>My name is Ivan Compañy, I was born in Alicante (Spain), and I’m currently living in Vancouver (Canada). During my more than 10 years of experience I’ve been lucky enough to play with tens of programming languages, hundreds of libraries and thousands of lines of code. But I also lived tens of working environments, hundreds of teammates and thousands of experiences. Maybe talking about a mixture of those two worlds can be interesting to somebody.</p>\n<h2>Why this?</h2>\n<p>When I thought about creating this blog, my first (and most important) question I wanted to answer before even starting was “what are you trying to transmit here?“. I didn’t want to just do another development blog. Don’t get me wrong, those are great, but sometimes I miss hearing from the person that is behind the code example, and that’s why my goal with this is to <strong>provide a more personal vision of what is development for me</strong>. We will talk about languages, and I’ll give my opinion. We will talk about working experiences and I’ll talk about how I felt. We will talk about libraries and I’ll talk about how hard was for me to use them.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this slightly different vision of my job will be helpful in a way and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I do writing it. Let’s go :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World","date":"March 01, 2021","description":"Welcome!"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/testing-post/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Testing post"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/02-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Beginnings"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"87bda8f2-c32e-5742-a522-bb6ba80d5631","previousPostId":"01cfe5bc-b039-5658-ba81-666ebe3a0eaf","nextPostId":"caf6d89b-0a58-5463-9510-c33d903373d3"}},
