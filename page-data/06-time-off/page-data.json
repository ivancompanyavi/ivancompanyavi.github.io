The reasons were different,\nbut a lot of them were related to my mental state regarding my visa in Canada.\nLong-story short, I had a pretty rough time dealing with my visa process, and\nat the same time I worked for Hootsuite. Living in a foreign country is usually\npretty stressful, specially during your first years, and unfortunately I\ncouldn’t do a clear mental separation between my personal and my professional\nlife. Because of that, I started feeling like I wasn’t giving my 100% at work\nand the last thing I wanted to be was a bad professional, so I decided to move\non.</p>\n<h2>Resetting</h2>\n<p>Before starting thinking about what to do next, I thought I needed to do a\nmental reset so I can really feel I’m being a good developer. My approach was\npretty simple: spend a month off and later on, start looking for jobs. For the\nones who don’t know, Vancouver is a city where it rains <a href=\"https://vancouver.weatherstats.ca/charts/count_rain-yearly.html\">quite a\nlot</a>, so when\nthe weather gets better in summer, you really want to get the best of it. I\nlike to run and do all kind of outdoor activities so I thought it would be the\nbest thing in the world.</p>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>The only thing I didn’t take into account was that apart from doing exercise, I\nalso like to code (and sometimes I can become a bit workaholic). What’s the\nproblem with that? well, that a week or two after I started with my time off, I\nstarted feeling anxious for not having a job. Me and my wife are lucky enough\nto be able to live with only one of our salaries, so there was no rush, but I\nunconsciously needed to feel like I was being useful (although I was taking\ncare of all the house-related chores).</p>\n<h2>The “solution”</h2>\n<p>There was only one way I saw possible for me to really enjoy my time: I’ll turn\nthings around, start looking for jobs so when I get one, I can actually have a\ngreat time. So here I went, starting looking for jobs, to see how the market\nwas, while I did outdoor exercise. I’ll talk in a different post how was my\nexperience interviewing, but for this post’s sake, you just have to know that\nit didn’t work as I expected, and here are the reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>While you interview, you have to focus on it and study, so you don’t actually\nfeel like you are having a time off.</li>\n<li>Interview processes can take a lot of time (sometimes months).</li>\n<li>The job market is <strong>HUGE</strong>, specially in north-america, which sometimes makes\nit even harder to know what to apply to. Don’t get me wrong, it’s great\nhaving so many opportunities out there, it’s just a bit more stressful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All these things made it more challenging to me to rest while I had to look for\njobs.</p>\n<h2>The advice</h2>\n<p>Probably my take-away from all this would be: know yourself before deciding to\nhave some time off and really think if you are going to be able to really rest.\nIn my case it ended up working, it simply wasn’t as I expected.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Time off","date":"August 01, 2021","description":"What was no working for two months"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/05-stress/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stress"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"b49e97ff-2af0-538e-8a60-fc8ae5a00e5e","previousPostId":"72f59106-f76f-5848-9f58-656019ce3202","nextPostId":null}},
