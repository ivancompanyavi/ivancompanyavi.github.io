description: "What was no working for two months" 
---

This summer I decided to give myself some time off. The reasons were different,
but a lot of them were related to my mental state regarding my visa in Canada.
Long-story short, I had a pretty rough time dealing with my visa process, and
at the same time I worked for Hootsuite. Living in a foreign country is usually
pretty stressful, specially during your first years, and unfortunately I
couldn't do a clear mental separation between my personal and my professional
life. Because of that, I started feeling like I wasn't giving my 100% at work
and the last thing I wanted to be was a bad professional, so I decided to move
on.

## Resetting

Before starting thinking about what to do next, I thought I needed to do a
mental reset so I can really feel I'm being a good developer. My approach was
pretty simple: spend a month off and later on, start looking for jobs. For the
ones who don't know, Vancouver is a city where it rains [quite a
lot](https://vancouver.weatherstats.ca/charts/count_rain-yearly.html), so when
the weather gets better in summer, you really want to get the best of it. I
like to run and do all kind of outdoor activities so I thought it would be the
best thing in the world.

## The problem

The only thing I didn't take into account was that apart from doing exercise, I
also like to code (and sometimes I can become a bit workaholic). What's the
problem with that? well, that a week or two after I started with my time off, I
started feeling anxious for not having a job. Me and my wife are lucky enough
to be able to live with only one of our salaries, so there was no rush, but I
unconsciously needed to feel like I was being useful (although I was taking
care of all the house-related chores).

## The "solution"

There was only one way I saw possible for me to really enjoy my time: I'll turn
things around, start looking for jobs so when I get one, I can actually have a
great time. So here I went, starting looking for jobs, to see how the market
was, while I did outdoor exercise. I'll talk in a different post how was my
experience interviewing, but for this post's sake, you just have to know that
it didn't work as I expected, and here are the reasons:

- While you interview, you have to focus on it and study, so you don't actually
  feel like you are having a time off.
- Interview processes can take a lot of time (sometimes months).
- The job market is **HUGE**, specially in north-america, which sometimes makes
  it even harder to know what to apply to. Don't get me wrong, it's great
  having so many opportunities out there, it's just a bit more stressful.

All these things made it more challenging to me to rest while I had to look for
jobs.

## The advice

Probably my take-away from all this would be: know yourself before deciding to
have some time off and really think if you are going to be able to really rest.
In my case it ended up working, it simply wasn't as I expected.
